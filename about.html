          First Hyderabad Book Fair was held in the year 1985 at City Central Library, Ashok Nagar, Hyderabad. A few essential publishers and Booksellers participated in the fair. There was an enormous response from the book lovers and the people of Hyderabad. 
          Later on, the Book Fairs were held at Nizam College Grounds, Public Gardens, Exhibition Grounds, Keshav
          Memorial High School Ground etc. From the last four year onwards it has been continuously running at
          Telangana Kala Bharati (NTR Grounds). Within a short period, the Hyderabad Book Fair has become very popular throughout India. After the bifurcation of the united Andhra Pradesh this book fair running in a different way involving the book lovers, writers and the Telugu literary personalities with the help of the Govt. of Telangana.
                 <br> <br>

          It has been taking activities like organising seminars, conducting various activities to promote book reading habit among children in different schools. Moreover, for the first time in the history, Hyderabad Book Fair Society initiated the fairs in different districts such as Khammam, Warangal, Karimnagar, Kottagudem, Kodad, Mahaboobnagar, Kamareddy, Wanaparthy etc.
            
          <br><br>
          The team of Hyderabad Book Fair Society working collectively to take the aim and spirit of the Book
          Fair Society into the people of Telangana. During Book Fair, the writers' involvement is excellent.
          They are being given the stage to share their lectures and opinions, especially on Telugu literature. 
          Book release activities are also taken up at the Book Fair. And at this 
          Juncture we should be thankful to the Telugu Print and Electronic media for promoting the Book reading 
          habit and inculcating the reading habit among the people by giving stories.
            
          <br><br>
          Children activities in the Book Fair such as storytelling, painting, dancing, cultural programmes and poetry reading, ensure participation of children. We have been allocating a particular stall to Telugu language writers books for five years. We take pride to claim that nearly 300 publishers participate in our Book Fair every year.
            
          <br><br>
            Now Hyderabad Book Fair has reached National Level and is running as Hyderabad National Book Fair.
